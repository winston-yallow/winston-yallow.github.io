## About

I will mostly write about game development as a hobby. The engine that I use for most
projects is the Godot Game Engine.

I started this blog for myself. I want to have a place where I can write down interesting things. This
is a place for me to collect everything important that I discover while learning to use godot. This is
not meant to be a place for in depth tutorials. Please keep in mind that I am still learning.

Not all posts will be about game development. Other things that I find interesting include Rust, Python, 
and Web Development. 

### Tools

This is a list of tools that I often use for game development.
